<h1 align = "center">Predition of Marks</h1>

This project will let you estimate the percentage of marks a students can be able to secure with considering the aspect the amount of time that the student have spent in improving their skills. Although time is not a proper measure to estimate such things as it also depends on Students IQ, Students Interest and many other thing.

Consider we doing an experiment in your laboratory observing what a particular factor will effect the experimental data. So, to know how this factor is effecting the data of experiment we will keep all other factor to be constant. In a similar way we are following same pattern here as how the time spent on improving skills will change the percentage of marks student is going to achive.

<h2 align ="center">Pre requsites</h2>

- Knowlege on Python
- Knowlege on Databases
  - Database can be in different formats. Some example such format are :
    1. Excel file
    2. CSV file
    3. SQL database
- Knowlege on Python Frameworks as follows:
  1. Pandas
  2. NumPy
  3. Matplotlib
  4. Scikit

<h2 align = "center">Database or Dataset</h2>

The link for the data set which is in CSV format is given below:

[Click here to direct to the file](https://bit.ly/w-data)

- You can directly paste the above link while reading the file in program.

```python
      read_csv("link")
```

- You can copy the data in file and save it in the CSV format.

```python
      read_csv("filename.csv")
```

- You can make a table in SQL and insert these values.

```python
      read_sql(connection to database)
```

<h2 align = "center">Instlling all libraries</h2>

Installing Pandas:

> pip3 install pandas

Installing NumPy:

> pip3 install numpy

Installing Matplotlib:

> pip3 install matplotlib

Installing Scikit:

> pip3 install -U scikit-learn

> or

> pip install -U scikit-learn

<h2 align = "center">Computational Environment</h2>

You can use any one of the environments mentioned below to run this code. I have used Jupyter Notebook extesnion in vs code.

- Jupyter Notebook
- Google colab

You can also prepare it python file.

<h2 align = "center">Linear Regression</h2>
We have used Linear Regression which best suit our model.

**Linear Regression** is defined as linear approch for modelling the relationship between scalar response with the help of one or more explanatory variables.

The case of deriving a responce from one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression.

Which is similar in this project we use number of hours a student studied which is our explanator variable which estimates the percentage of marks the student is going to get in his examination.
